# Analysis of the peak-time at the gym

Due to the pandemic, most of the gyms start to add the limitation on the tolerant number of people. 
To avoid the peak-time at the gym, this project designs a webpage crawler in `gym_crawler.ipynb` to fetch the instant number of people at the given gym. 
Moreover, the fetched data are saved under `csv_files` directory.
By executing `plot_figures.ipynb`, figures are plotted and stored under the `figure/` directory.
